## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox



### What I learned

I learned how to effectively center a div by aligning the parent element.

`
```css
some css code i'm proud of
.parent {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100vh;
}
```

### Continued development
I would continue to do more projects on FrontEnd mentor. And upskill even to Javascript and react.
